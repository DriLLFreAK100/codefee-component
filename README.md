# Codefee Component

A Core UI Web Components for Codefee Works. 
The project is built using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), a toolchain that simplifies the development of Web Components or Custom Elements.

# Core
The **Core** is built using Stencil. That being said, the resulting components written here are actually [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

The resulting package can be used directly in the web and is easily manipulatable via plain VanillaJS. 

Available on NPM - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codefee-component/core
