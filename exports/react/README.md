# Codefee-Component (React)

This is a React component library wrapper for [@codefee-component/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codefee-component/core).

It utilizes build option from [Stencil's React Binding](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react#bindings). 

The build output is then moved to this React Component Library and re-exported subsequently.
