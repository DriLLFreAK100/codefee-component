# Codefee-Component (Angular)

This is an Angular component library wrapper for [@codefee-component/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codefee-component/core).

It utilizes Stencil's default output target type - 'angular'. Refer to the Core's [stencil.config.ts](https://github.com/DriLLFreAK100/codefee-component/blob/main/stencil.config.ts)

The build output is then moved to this Angular Component Library and re-exported subsequently.


### Available on NPM - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codefee-component/angular
